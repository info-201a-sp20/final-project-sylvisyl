# Final Project

 ### Domain of interest
 - We are interested in <h4>*housing in King County*</h4>because we all attend college in King County and consider it to be our home, even if just temporarily. Housing and homelessness are hot topics in Seattle right now and pressing issues. We’d all like to learn more about it.

 - We found datasets on [**education**](https://data.seattle.gov/Education/SPP-Enrollment/ix3q-qr7w), [**transportation**](https://data.seattle.gov/Land-Base/Zip-Codes/w69d-ihb8), and [**public safety**](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Officer-Involved-Shooting-OIS-Data/mg5r-efcm) in King County. This is all related to [**housing**](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) because housing prices and homelessness levels correlate with education, transportation, and public safety levels in a community.

- We hope to answer the questions:
 1. How house prices have changed in King County?
 1. How the rate of house sales have changed?
 1. What the most expensive zip codes are?
 1. What zip codes have the most/least number of sales?
 1. What the average square foot of houses purchases are, etc?

 > Describes how the question can be answered using data (e.g., a specific comparison within or analysis of the data that answers the question) (1 point)
