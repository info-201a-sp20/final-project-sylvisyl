# Final Project

<br>

## Domain of interest
We are interested in <h4>*housing in King County*</h4>because we all attend college in King County and consider it to be our home, even if just temporarily. Housing and homelessness are hot topics in Seattle right now and pressing issues. We’d all like to learn more about it.

<br>

We found these three data driven projects to help us understand the domain:

 1. [United States House Price Index MoM Change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/housing-index)

 It documents the percentage of change in average housing prices throughout the country every month.

 2. [Barchart: Housing Price Index](https://www.barchart.com/economy/housing)

 It’s a website that uses graphic visualizations and spreadsheets to present housing price indexes in different continents or different states within the USA. (A house price index measures the price changes of residential housing as a percentage change from some specific start date)

 3. [Neighborhood Scqut: Washingotn Appericaiton rates trend and housing market data](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/wa/real-estate)

 It has an interactive map that demonstrate how different regions were divided and an interactive charts next to it for the users to narrow down the region selection.

<br>

 We hope to answer the questions:
 - **How house prices have changed in King County?**

 This can be answered by the king county house sale data and by grouping the same type of house (size and location) and comparing them through different year sale prices.

 - **What zip codes have the most/least number of sales?**

 This can be answered by the king county house sale data and by grouping the zip codes and sum up the number of houses each location sale.


 - **what the average square foot of houses purchases are?**

 This can be answered by looking into the king county house sale data and by analyzing the sqft column, for example, use the mean function to find out the result.

 - **What is the quality of preschool education in King County?**

 This can be answered by comparing if the King County Average CLASS Scores meet the score goal from SPP.
